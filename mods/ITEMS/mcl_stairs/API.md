# API for `mcl_stairs`
Register your own stairs and slabs!

This mod has both a new API and an old deprecated one kept for backwards
compatibility.  The primary difference is that the new API takes a definition
table rather than multiple arguments and that the description of registered
stair/slabs are generated from a base description which is either specified or
derived from the node they are based on.

## Example
Register stair and slab based on the node `example:platinumblock`:

```lua
mcl_stairs.register_stair("platinum", {
    recipeitem = "example:platinumblock",
    base_description = S("Platinum"),
})
```

This will register the nodes `mcl_stairs:stair_platinum` and
`mcl_stairs:slab_platinum`.

## `mcl_stairs.register_stair(subname, stair definition)`
Registers stair and slab from the stair definition.  The subname has to be
unique and not used by any other stair registration.  Properties like groups,
hardness and blast resistance for the registered nodes are derived from the
node they are based on.

This function will register the nodes `mcl_stairs:stair_<subname>` and
`mcl_stairs:slab_<subname>`.  The nodes `mcl_stairs:stair_<subname>_inner`,
`mcl_stairs:stair_<subname>_outer`, `mcl_stairs:slab_<subname>_top` and
`mcl_stairs:slab_<subname>_double` which are only used for placed nodes will
also be registered.

## Stair definition
Used by `mcl_stairs.register_stair`.

```lua
{
    recipeitem = "",
    -- Node which the registered stair and slab are based on. It is also
    -- used for their crafting recipes.

    base_description = "",
    -- String used for generating stair/slab descriptions.  The generated
    -- descriptions will have the form "<base_description> Stairs" and
    -- "<base_description> Slab".  Defaults to the description of the node
    -- defined in `recipeitem` if left empty.

    register_stair = true,
    -- If stair should be registered.

    register_slab = true,
    -- If slab should be registered.

    register_craft = true,
    -- If crafting recipes should be registered.

    extra_groups = {},
    -- Additional groups which get added to the registered nodes.

    tiles = {},
}
```

## Backwards compatible API
This section describes old `mcl_stairs` API which has been deprecated.

### `mcl_stairs.register_stair_and_slab_simple(subname, sourcenode, desc_stair, desc_slab, double_description, corner_stair_texture_override)`
Register a simple stair and a slab. The stair and slab will inherit all attributes from `sourcenode`. The `sourcenode` is also used as the item for crafting recipes.

This function is meant for simple nodes; if you need more flexibility, use one of the other functions instead.

See `register_stair` and `register_slab` for the itemstrings of the registered nodes.

#### Parameters
* `subname`: Name fragment for node itemstrings (see `register_stair` and `register_slab`)
* `sourcenode`: The node on which this stair is based on
* `desc_stair`: Description of stair node
* `desc_slab`: Description of slab node
* `double_description`: Description of double slab node
* `corner_stair_texture_override`: Optional, see `register_stair`

### `mcl_stairs.register_stair_and_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, desc_stair, desc_slab, sounds, hardness, double_description, corner_stair_texture_override)`
Register a simple stair and a slab, plus crafting recipes. In this function, you need to specify most things explicitly.

#### Parameters
* `desc_stair`: Description of stair node
* `desc_slab`: Description of slab node
* Other parameters: Same as for `register_stair` and `register_slab`

### `mcl_stairs.register_stair(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds, hardness, corner_stair_texture_override)`
Registers a stair. This also includes the inner and outer corner stairs, they are added automatically. Also adds crafting recipes.

The itemstrings for the registered nodes will be of the form:

* `mcl_stairs:stair_<subname>`: Normal stair
* `mcl_stairs:stair_<subname>_inner`: Inner stair
* `mcl_stairs:stair_<subname>_outer`: Outer stair

#### Parameters
* `subname`: Name fragment for node itemstrings (see above)
* `recipeitem`: Item for crafting recipe. Use `group:` prefix to use a group instead
* `groups`: Groups used for stair
* `images`: Textures
* `description`: Stair description/tooltip
* `sounds`: Sounds table
* `hardness`: MCL2 block hardness value
* `corner_stair_texture_override`: Optional. Custom textures for corner stairs, see below

`groups`, `images`, `sounds` or `hardness` can be `nil`, in which case the value is inhereted from the `recipeitem`.

##### `corner_stair_texture_override`
This optional parameter specifies the textures to be used for corner stairs. 

It can be one of the following data types:

* string: one of:
    * "default": Use same textures as original node
    * "woodlike": Take first frame of the original tiles, then take a triangle piece
                  of the texture, rotate it by 90Â° and overlay it over the original texture
* table: Specify textures explicitly. Table of tiles to override textures for
         inner and outer stairs. Table format:
             { tiles_def_for_outer_stair, tiles_def_for_inner_stair }
* nil: Equivalent to "default"

### `mcl_stairs.register_slab(subname, recipeitem, groups, images, description, sounds, hardness, double_description)`
Registers a slab and a corresponding double slab. Also adds crafting recipe.

The itemstrings for the registered nodes will be of the form:

* `mcl_stairs:slab_<subname>`: Slab
* `mcl_stairs:slab_<subname>_top`: Upper slab, used internally
* `mcl_stairs:slab_<subname>_double`: Double slab

#### Parameters
* `double_description`: Node description/tooltip for double slab
* Other parameters: Same as for `register_stair`
